      <title>Refunds for Scam Victims</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may have heard of a recent scam that involved transferring money to scammers via Western Union. If you or someone you know fell victim to this, we may have some good news for you! The Federal Trade Commission recently announced that consumers who lost money to scammers who told them to pay via Western Union’s money transfer system between January 1, 2004, and January 19, 2017, can file a claim to be refunded. You can start the claims process by visiting &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/western-union-settlement-faqs" target="_blank"&gt;FTC.gov/WU&lt;/a&gt; before February 12, 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the FTC, the refund program follows a settlement with the Western Union Company, which in January 2017 agreed to pay $586 million to resolve charges brought by the FTC and the U. S. Department of Justice. More information about the scam, refunds, and claims process can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/western-union-settlement-faqs" target="_blank"&gt;FTC.gov/WU&lt;/a&gt;. Filing a claim is free, so you should not pay anyone to file a claim on your behalf. And remember, no one associated with the claims process will call &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you for your bank account or credit card number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; like this can have lasting impacts on the lives of those affected. Here at Xceed, it’s our goal to help our members keep their finances and personal information safe, which is why we’ve put together a list of ways you can protect yourself and common scams to look out for at &lt;a href="https://www.xfcu.org/education/resources/common-scams/" target="_blank"&gt;xfcu.org/education&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Hit the Pause Button</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online shopping is fast, convenient, and cheap. It’s also an easy way to spend impulsively. That’s why I’ve instituted a two day waiting period for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I want to shop for something online, I add it to my cart, and then I walk away for at least two days. Yep. Two days. If after two days I still want or need that item (and I’ve budgeted for it), I can click “buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the impulse I felt has passed, and I delete the item from my cart and move on with my life. When it’s still a must-have, I check my email for coupons the retailer has sent me—you’d be surprised how often this happens—and bargain hunt at similar sites. I’ve also signed up for instant rebates and &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;price watchdog services&lt;/a&gt; to help me maximize my savings on each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By hitting “pause” on your online shopping, you can curb that spending habit, and save yourself from a houseful of items you don’t actually need!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Increase Your Pay</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Budgeting is a great tool to start your savings journey and manage your money, but once you’re a well-oiled make-coffee-at-home machine, it’s time to start looking for other ways to increase your savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable tools for that is, well, you! If you work at a salaried job, consider asking for a raise. Do your research on what similar positions in your company and field make, and be prepared to negotiate with your boss to get that increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a freelancer or someone who does odd jobs, look at your rates. If it’s been a while since you’ve raised them, you’re likely due for a bump. Again – research is key! Look at the market around you and make sure you’re remaining competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve secured that pay increase—and this is the important part—put the extra money in savings! You’ve been doing just fine without it, so you won’t miss it when it’s automatically added to your &lt;a href="https://www.xfcu.org/banking/personal/savings/"&gt;savings account&lt;/a&gt;. Your future self will thank you, and you’ll get the satisfaction of seeing your hard work build up your nest egg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To Split or Not to Split</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When going to a restaurant with a group, it’s fairly common that the bill is split evenly when the check comes. However, that doesn’t have to be the case!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re eating at a pricier joint than you’re used to, or you’re focused on cutting down non-essential spending, it’s perfectly okay to suggest that everyone pay for what they ate or even request a separate bill from your server. Just remember that it’s better to do this early in the meal so no one is surprised at the end of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time comes to settle up, you can use Xceed's &lt;a href="https://www.xfcu.org/banking/personal/xceed-online/utransfer/#persontoperson"&gt;uTransfer&lt;/a&gt; feature to easily pay back whoever puts down their card for the meal, or have someone repay you if you covered the bill!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pack a Travel Snack</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether you’re traveling for work or for pleasure, there’s nothing worse than being stuck with no choice but to buy a pricey snack when hunger hits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skip the aggravation of having to find and pay for (often expensive) food while traveling by carrying a few snacks with you. Granola bars, trail mix, and dried fruit are all great options, as is instant oatmeal in a small reusable container – just add hot water and you’re ready to go! You can pick up your snacks prepackaged at a grocery or health food store, or unlock your inner DIY gene and collect nuts, dried fruits, and chocolate bits to make your own trail mix or snack bar (just add honey!). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best part? All of these snacks can easily be added to your carry-on or jacket pocket so they’re readily available when hunger strikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
